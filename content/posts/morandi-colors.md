## What is Morandi Color?

Giorgio Morandi was an Italian painter and printmaker who specialized in still life. His paintings are noted for their tonal subtlety in depicting apparently simple subjects, which were limited mainly to vases, bottles, bowls, flowers and landscapes.

The "Morandi color scheme" refers to a muted, dusty color palette that conveys a sense of calm and elegance. It is achieved by adding gray or white to bright colors, lowering their saturation.

### Key Characteristics

*   **Low Saturation**: The colors are not vivid or striking but rather soft and soothing.
*   **Gray Undertone**: Almost every color seems to have a layer of gray dust over it.
*   **Harmonous**: Because they share a similar tonal value, Morandi colors match each other effortlessly.

## Applying in Web Design

When using this palette for a website, consider the following:

1.  **Backgrounds**: Use very light gray-blues or warm beiges instead of pure white.
2.  **Typography**: Avoid pure black. Use dark grays (e.g., `#2C353C`) for better readability and lower eye strain.
3.  **Accents**: Use slightly deeper tones of the same hue for buttons and links.

This website uses a **Cold Morandi** scheme, focusing on dusty blues (`#889CA9`) and cool grays.
