## Why Hugo?

Hugo is one of the most popular open-source static site generators. With its amazing speed and flexibility, Hugo makes building websites fun again.

*   **Speed**: It builds pages in milliseconds.
*   **Simplicity**: Content is written in Markdown.
*   **Security**: Static sites are inherently more secure than dynamic ones (like WordPress).

## Customizing the Toha Theme

I chose the [Toha](https://github.com/hugo-toha/toha) theme for its clean card-based layout. However, I wanted a unique look, so I customized:

1.  **Color Scheme**: Switched to a "Cold Morandi" palette for a modern, professional feel.
2.  **Typography**: Enhanced readability with the Mulish font.
3.  **Layout**: Tweaked the experience section to match the education card style.

Stay tuned for more updates as I add more project details!
