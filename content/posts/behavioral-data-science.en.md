## The Intersection

Behavioral Data Science is an emerging field that combines the rigor of data science with the insights of behavioral psychology. It aims to understand, predict, and influence human behavior using large datasets.

### From Psychology to Code

My background in Psychology at NTU provided a strong foundation in understanding human cognition and social interaction. However, I realized that to truly analyze the complexity of human behavior at scale, I needed computational tools.

### Research Focus

At the CHEN Lab, we focus on:

*   **Multimodal Interaction**: Analyzing video, audio, and physiological signals.
*   **Social Dynamics**: How people interact in groups vs. individually.
*   **Human-AI Interaction**: How AI agents influence human decision-making.

This journey has been challenging but incredibly rewarding, bridging the gap between soft science and hard data.
